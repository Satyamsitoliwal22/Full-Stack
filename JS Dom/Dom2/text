1.Browser events - it is like an annoucement we want that we want when we click then only the java script file runs not at starting only

1.event target - it is a top level entity,interface
 in this event is clicking button and there is listner which decide what to do action after this 
methods are 
->add event listner
->remove event listner
->dispatch event

1.add event listner
it require 3 things
1.event target- konsa component pa (p,h1,document ,div,article video)
2.event type- click,scroll,etc
3.function- it is like a action define what we have to do

example document.addEventListener('click',function(){console.log('i clicked on documenet')});

2.remove event listner
-> it is remove the change created by event listner by using same function as used in event listner
->as in javassrcipt two function with same reult is differnt because they w=ae two different object
-> it works when these condition get fullfilled
1.same target
2.same type
3.same function

Phases of event-
1.capturing phase-it is a phase where finding event listner in code
2.at target phase- in this we get an event listner
3.bubbling phase-in this we backtrack after getting event listner to intial postion
